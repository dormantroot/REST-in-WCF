This is a sample project that I'll be developing as I learn about REST and its implementation in WCF Web API.

REST_in_WCF
-> Is a simple ASP.NET MVC 3 project which includes the latest WCF Web APIs. You shouldn't have any problems with the dependencies b/c I used NuGet to include the related WCF Web APIs into the project. However, if you do encounter any issues, please resort to NuGet.

You can find the associated literature on www.dormantroot.com. Let me know if you are having any issues or questions. dormantroot@gmail.com    twitter: @dormantroot
